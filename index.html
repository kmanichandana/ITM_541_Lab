    <p>Aspiring Web Developer</p>
    <p class="text">In the past I worked as a Programmer Analyst in Cognizant Technology Solutions, where i got introduced to web development tools such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I got basic working knowledge in creating webpages from my work experience.
        In my free time I inspect various websites and study various elements used in them and how the webpage layout is designed and try to implement them by myself. Till now everything i Have learnt about web develpment is completely on my own.
        Now in order to boost my skills and gain more knowledge in web applications development, I have decided to take this Web Application Foundations Course at IIT.
